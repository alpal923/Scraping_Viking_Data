Scraping Data:
- Typo in the first line “Al” > “I”
- storing details as a json was an cool idea!
- explanation was very in depth, and I could follow your process well
- I would add a link to your second data collection blog at the bottom

Unveiling the Magic:
⁃ In the getting started you have a text paragraph with a bunch of package imports, is that supposed to be formatted differently?
⁃ I’m impressed with a lot of the stuff you’ve added that we didn’t cover in class, like batching and caching and some of the other packages
⁃ Once again is to maybe link to your previous data collection blog, and at the end you could link to your EDA

Trevor Hancock:
I thought this was really well done, you were clear in explaining your steps and your code, and your graphs look good. I thought the analysis was good at pointing out something interesting I didn't immediately notice about the data. Perhaps more graphs could've been used for the comparitive analysis of dig sites as there is a lot going on in those two.
